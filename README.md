# React deployment test

This is a test app built to test the deployment instructions for GitHub pages.



The test deployment was successful, including re-deploying with changes.



To deploy this app I followed the instructions on this video exactly:

### How to Deploy React App to GitHub Pages | Step by step.

The biggest takeaway here was not to touch the Github pages page or launch a deploy manually, but to do it in the CLI as in the video.

To redeploy with changes, running npm run deploy and waiting a couple of minutes works.
